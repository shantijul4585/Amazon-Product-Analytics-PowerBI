# Amazon-Product-Analytics-PowerBI
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to perform comprehensive sales analysis on Amazon product data using Power BI. This includes cleaning and transforming raw sales data, building robust data models, and developing an interactive dashboard to track key performance metrics such as Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales, Quarter-to-Date (QTD) Sales, Products Sold, and Customer Reviews. The goal is to provide actionable insights into product performance, sales trends, and customer engagement to support data-driven decision-making.
